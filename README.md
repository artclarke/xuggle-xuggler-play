# Xuggle-Xuggler-Play framework demo application

This shows how to integrate Xuggler into a Play application.  See
the conf/depenencies.yml file for the key magic to download xuggler.

You'll need to make sure your operating system is using a version
of Xuggler that can run on it (Windows Vista and higher,
Mac OS X 10.7 and higher, Ubuntu 11.10 and higher, and CentOS 6.0
and higher are supported out of the box, in 32 or 64 bit JVMs).

## Running the application locally

Download and install the <a href="http://www.playframework.org/">Play Framework</a> and install.  We tested this with Play 1.2.4 and Xuggler 5.4.

Make sure your play framework install directory is on your path. Then navigate to the application directory and run the app with:

    $play run
